Debugging?
	Changed some code in the generation of L. Now the structure has vanished.
	What happened? Was L wrong, or the analysis? Go through and ensure trust in all stages.

Anatomy of the program
   main	
   Generating data
      gen_data.m
         disorder_H
            inputs: System length & disorder strength OK 
            outputs: Hamiltonian: Looks fine... Nice diagonal structure from the tensor prod
         vec_to_graph
	    Suspicious! Diagonal of A looks super wrong. First elt always zero?!
		Fixed! Wasn't including diagonal of A in the generating loop
	 get_network_data
		Seems OK. Just extracts a bunch of stuff from the loaded file... And performs OK in tests.

	display_network_data
		OK, a bit of a mess. Let's clean up as we debug. Then push and go home.
