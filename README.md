# Many-body localization through the graph state lens

Concepts from quantum information theory are used to reverse the conventional definition of a graph state and assign to a given many-body state a *mutual information graph*. Structural properties of this graph and the spectrum of its matrix representation are found to uncover signatures of the many-body localization transition in the Pal-Huse model.

## Getting started

For a primer on the physics background to this project, read the [background](ref/background.md).

The findings of this project are reported in [results](ref/results.md).

To use the code, see **Usage**.
