# An untitled report

## Background

* Thermalization as foundational issue in thermodynamics
* Connections with gravity & computational complexity cf Nature feature
* Many-body localization as  testbed for emergence of thermalization
	* Experimental & theoretical results naturally pointing to graph state picture
* Graph states and structuralism
* In this work... Synthesize approaches in QIT, MBL, and graph theory
* Key findings
	* Duality of complexity! cf emergent integrability & LIOMS?
	* Emergence of global ordering from local order!
	* Not observables, strictly, but global structural properties that can be probed with one-site tomography

## Introduction to concepts & methods

* Spin chain
	* Known properties
* Exact diagonalization
* QMI
	* Definition
	* Relation to correlation functions & entanglement measures
	* classical bounds and mixed states?
* Graph theoretic concepts

## Eigenstates

* Results
	* Homo/heterogeneity
		* Weights & Degrees
	* Emergence of graph scales
		* Centrality & clustering
		* Bifurcation in correlation between degree & QMI, for example
	* Higher order properties
		* Higher-order 'hidden' information
			* 'width' of correlation band 
	* Size scaling
	* Laplacian spectra & separability?!
		* Exactly what IS the spectrum...?
		* Spectral gaps (Fielder vectors)/level spacing
		* Plot mean (ordered) spectra
		* 
* Interpretation
	* volume in 'graph space' larger near critical point
	* Connection to quantum computing complexity
		* Deep MBL -> low-weight graph states, thermal -> long-range entangling gates


## Dynamical evolution

* Setup: Pure product initial state, 'empty' graph
* Results
	* Initial transients
	* Stead-state
* Interpretation

## Discussion

* What, if anything, can be predicted purely from the disorder vector?
	* Sounds like an ML project... Given L Zeeman splittings, can you predict the graph behaviour? 
		* Look to existing renormalization methods
* Unique graph-related insights?
	* Prospective: Graph-based renormalization -> neural network representations of quantum states
* Moving towards 'nonlocal dof'... 
* Free & bound energies, information, & local equilibrium

## Conclusion & future work
