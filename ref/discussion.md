# Discussion
  As found by de Tomasi et al, the extended phase is characterized by robust long-distance (with respect to the underlying lattice) QMI, while the localized phase corresponds to moderate short-range connections and a strong suppression of long-range correlations.

  imagine a many-body state consisting of weakly entangled subsystems who are themselves internally strongly entangled. This question leads to the study of partitions of the QMI graph and to the application of spectral graph theory to the information-theoretic structure of quantum many-body physics.


In the extended phase, most nodes are equally well connected, with some more strongly than the mode. In the extended phase, most degrees are quite weak, reflecting poorly-connected nodes, with a small probability of being more strongly connected. The log-log plot suggests a power-law scaling of the probability of finding a node with a given degree, which is characteristic of scale-free graphs. Notice that for small disorder strength past the onset of localization, the mode of the degree distribution actually increases, suggesting a strengthening of the overall mutual information integration (CLARIFY) in the system.  The degree distribution exhibits a much clearer distinction thann the weight distribution between the localized and extended phases in its density diagram. Moreover, the probability distributions themselves have markedly different shapes, but I propose they are parametrized by a single probability distribution.



# Centrality
One can phrase the question of centrality in other ways. For example, given a node of high degree, how likely is it to be connected to other nodes of high degree? Figure 3 shows the PDF and CDF of the weighted mean of neighbours. $\mu$ compares the mean of the degree of the neighbours of $i$ to the mean degree of all nodes other than $i$.  A value of $\mu_i=0$ shows that system $i$ is poorly connected, as either it has neighbours of low degree or it has only weak connections or both. A large $\mu_i$ indicates that the nodes connected strongly to system $i$ are also strongly connected relative to the mean, and so form a central cluster in the global system. For the localized phase, the distribution of $\mu$ peaks sharply at 1, showing that almost all nodes are equally central - the graph is nearly uniformly completely connected.
