<p>###Structural properties</p>
<p>The most obvious avenue of inquiry is the distribution of weights among the graph. As found by de Tomasi et al, the extended phase is characterized by robust long-distance (with respect to the underlying lattice) QMI, while the localized phase corresponds to moderate short-range connections and a strong suppression of long-range correlations. The detailed distibution of weights in the graph support this, as shown in figure 1.</p>

<p>In the localized phase, the weight distribution is sharply peaked. In the localized phase, the distribution is visible broader, with many more edges at much lower strengths than the localized phase (note the negative log in the horizontal axis). The change in concentration of edge strengths can also be seen in the cumulative distribution functions.</p>
<p>One can also define the  of a node in a graph by the sum of the weights of all the edges connected to it, <span class="math inline"><em>d</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> = ∑<sub><em>j</em></sub>ℐ<sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub></span>, i.e the sum of the <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>th row of the adjacency matrix (for undirected graphs, this is also the column sum). This is one measure of the centrality of the nodes of a graph, which in this context means sites that are strongly entangled with other, potentially distant, sites. The degree distribution is visible in figure 2.</p>

<p>In the extended phase, most nodes are equally well connected, with some more strongly than the mode. In the extended phase, most degrees are quite weak, reflecting poorly-connected nodes, with a small probability of being more strongly connected. The log-log plot suggests a power-law scaling of the probability of finding a node with a given degree, which is characteristic of scale-free graphs. Notice that for small disorder strength past the onset of localization, the mode of the degree distribution actually increases, suggesting a strengthening of the overall mutual information integration in the system. The degree distribution exhibits a much clearer distinction thann the weight distribution between the localized and extended phases in its density diagram. Moreover, the probability distributions themselves have markedly different shapes, but I propose they are parametrized by a single probability distribution.</p>
<p>One can phrase the question of centrality in other ways. For example, given a node of high degree, how likely is it to be connected to other nodes of high degree? Figure 3 shows the PDF and CDF of the weighted mean of neighbours, defined by <span class="math inline">$\mu_i = \frac{(L-1)\sum_{ij}\mathcal{I}_{ij}d_j}{\sum_{j\neq i} d_i}$</span>, where <span class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> is the total number of systems. <span class="math inline"><em>μ</em></span> compares the mean of the degree of the neighbours of <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> to the mean degree of all nodes other than <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>. A value of <span class="math inline"><em>μ</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> = 0</span> shows that system <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> is poorly connected, as either it has neighbours of low degree or it has only weak connections or both. A large <span class="math inline"><em>μ</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> indicates that the nodes connected strongly to system <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> are also strongly connected relative to the mean, and so form a central cluster in the global system. For the localized phase, the distribution of <span class="math inline"><em>μ</em></span> peaks sharply at 1, showing that almost all nodes are equally central - the graph is nearly uniformly completely connected.</p>

<p>One can also ask  neighbours a node is well-connected to. For example, one can imagine a many-body state consisting of weakly entangled subsystems who are themselves internally strongly entangled. This question naturally leads to the study of partitions of the QMI graph and to the application of spectral graph theory to the information-theoretic structure of quantum many-body physics.</p>
<p>###Graph spectral analysis</p>
<p>A central theme in the mathematical study of graphs is the search for heuristics of when graphs can be exactly or approximately partitioned by, for example, deleting all sufficiently weak couplings and retrieving a disjoint union of graphs. This captures the idea of cluster formation in many-body physics, and the graph construction provides several insights.</p>
<p>One can furnish the definition of <span class="math inline">ℷ</span> by constructing the  of the graph, defined by <br /><span class="math display"><em>L</em> = ℸ − ℷ</span><br /> where <span class="math inline">ℸ</span> is the diagonal matrix whose <span class="math inline"><em>i</em><em>i</em></span>th entry is the degree of node <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>. The Laplacian has the useful property that . For a disjoint union of <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span> graphs, then, the spectrum of <span class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> has a <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span>-degenerate null space. Equivalently, one can block-diagonalize both <span class="math inline">ℷ</span> and <span class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> with one matrix block for each connected component. </p>
